# Configuration files for the ESP32 DOIT DevKit and the ST7789 TFT display

These files are meant to be used with the [TFT_eSPI library][1].

You can choose which one of the two ESP32's freely usable SPI interfaces to use (HSPI or VSPI).

To use the configuration file simply replace the 'User_Setup.h' file in the TFT_eSPI library main directory and rename it.
